# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Several employees are approaching retirement age at fictional tech giant Pewlett Hackard.  In order to assist senior leadership in preparing for this "silver tsunami", PH needs to determine the number of retiring employees.  Senior leadership at PH would also like to fill these positions with up-and-coming star employees and allow them the opportunity to gain institutional knowledge and additional skills, so they have also asked for employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
